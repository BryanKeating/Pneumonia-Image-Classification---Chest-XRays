# Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Learning for Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-rays




## Overview: 

In an attempt to combat pneumonia deaths in developing countries, we created a model that is able to determine with 91% accuracy and 89% recall, whether or not a chest x-ray presents pneumonia or not. 

## Business Problem 

According to the Mayo Health Clinic, “Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.”

Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.

The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund(UNICEF)) and Save the Children joint task force came to us and presented their concerns relating to Pneumonia deaths in Children, particularly in poor and developing countries. 

Pneumonia is a disease of poverty. 99% of child deaths from pneumonia occur in developing countries. Within these high burden countries, it is the poorest and most marginalized children who are at greatest risk. Pneumonia kills more children than any other infectious disease, claiming the lives of over 800,000 children under five every year, or around 2,200 every day

Not only is there too little access to healthcare providers in these regions, things like travel distance, accessibility, and cost are all barriers for people getting to healthcare, but when they arrive, the offices and hospitals are understaffed and overworked. 

***"An estimated 18 million more health workers are needed by 2030 to prevent, diagnose and treat pneumonia..."(UNICEF)*** 

Lastly, and this is where we hope to make the most impact, there are **Too many undiagnosed or misdiagnosed Pneumonia patients. This is due to several of the previously mentioned reasons: Lack of access to healthcare, shortage of healthcare workers, and because doctors are short on time and can’t give their scans their due diligence.** 

We are here because we believe a child should not die because of where she was born or what resources her family has.
